# Software Requirement Specification (SRS)  
**Project:** Smart City Management Platform  
**Date:** September 10, 2025  

---

## 1. Introduction
The Smart City Management Platform is a centralized solution that enables city administrators to monitor, analyze, and optimize urban infrastructure. It provides dashboards, analytics, and real-time alerts for traffic, air quality, waste management, and utilities.

---

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Dashboard**
  - Display real-time data for sensors (traffic, air, waste, utilities).  
  - Charts and graphs for analytics.  
- **User Authentication**
  - Register/Login with JWT-based security.  
  - Role-based access (Admin, Operator, Viewer).  
- **Sensors**
  - Add, edit, delete sensors.  
  - Record sensor readings.  
- **Alerts**
  - Auto-generate alerts based on thresholds.  
  - View, acknowledge, and resolve alerts.  
- **Analytics**
  - Show trends, anomaly detection, optimization recommendations.  

---

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: Must support hundreds of sensors.  
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime for city-critical operations.  
- **Security**: JWT Authentication, role-based access.  
- **Performance**: API response time < 500ms for 90% of requests.  
- **Maintainability**: Modular backend + microservices (ML-service).  

---

## 4. Database Design
Tables:  
- **User**: id, name, email, passwordHash, role  
- **Sensor**: id, name, type, location, metadata  
- **SensorReading**: id, sensorId, timestamp, value  
- **Alert**: id, sensorId, level, message, createdAt, resolvedAt  

---

## 5. Use Case Diagram
- **Admin**: Manage users, sensors, alerts.  
- **Operator**: Resolve alerts.  
- **Viewer**: View dashboard only.  

---

## 6. Sequence Diagram (Alert Flow)
1. Sensor sends data → Backend stores reading.  
2. Threshold crossed → Alert generated.  
3. Alert pushed via Socket.io to frontend.  
4. Admin/Operator clicks Resolve → API updates database.  
5. Real-time update sent back to UI.
